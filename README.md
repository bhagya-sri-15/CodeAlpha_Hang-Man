# CodeAlpha_Hang-Man
The Hangman Game is a simple Python project where players guess a hidden word one letter at a time. A word is chosen randomly from five predefined options. Players have six chances to guess incorrectly. Using loops, lists, strings, and conditionals, the game tracks guesses, validates input, and ends with a win or loss message.
